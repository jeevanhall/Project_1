                                <p>Our target audience includes coffee consumers, college aged youth to seniors who are coffee lovers. Our focus is on anyone who has an interest in fair-trade coffee.  We want to promote awareness of less popular coffee sources. We are the opposite of Starbucks and Peteâ€™s Coffee. We want to attract people who are more sensitive to the plight of the farmers who are producing the coffee from the source.  Also coffee takes a short amount of time to brew, which makes it an easy, immediate pleasure and convenient as a commodity. Those who are more inclined to the most natural and traditional methods of coffee will be attracted to visit our website. </p>

                                <p>Most of the world's coffee production occurs in tropical regions close to the equator.  This region between the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of Capricorn, the coffee belt, extends 23.5 degrees north and south of the equator.  We learned that coffee is one of the most valuable global commodities traded through my investigation.  The genus Coffea features two species traded worldwide (Arabica and Robusta). Most people prefer Arabica due to its superb quality and taste.  The Arabica species directly affects the human sensory experience more significantly than Robusta.  Robusta coffee features a less potent and more bitter taste.  Robusta covers only 35% of the total world production, while Arabica covers 64%.  A third species Liberica lacks much demand or production internationally.</p>

                                <p>Coffee quality is defined by its sensorial aspects, which are developed by the chemical prototypes found in fresh grains.  Quality and content of the chemical composition of coffee beans widely vary based on the species of coffee, altitude, soil, daily temperature variations, and the place of growing.  Coffee taste is different due to the presence of different volatile and nonvolatile chemical constituents.</p>
